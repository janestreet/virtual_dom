  (** ['a Effect.t] represents some computation of type ['a] that can be performed outside
      of the typical computational/incremental structure of a Bonsai program . Examples of
      this computation might be:

      - Calling an RPC and getting the result back
      - Running expensive computation on a web-worker thread
      - Requesting some information from the imperative "Start.Handle"-holding code

      If you have a value of type ['a Effect.t], you can schedule it to be run by calling
      [inject] and providing a function that will be called when the callback completes. *)

  (** The [Par] module contains a Let_syntax whose [both] function executes the effects in
      parallel.

      This means that if you have a [let%map] or [let%bind], then bindings separated by
      `and` will run at the same time instead of being sequenced. *)

  (** An effect that never completes *)
  val never : 'a t

  (** Produces an effect that raises an exception when the effect is performed.

      Note: As long as this is handled by either [try_with]/[try_with_or_error] or
      [Expert.handle]/[Expert.eval] (with a non-raising [on_exn]), no exceptions will ever
      actually be raised. This should be safe to use in environments where raising
      exceptions is costly (or at the very least, better than raising directly). *)
  val raise : exn -> 'a t

  val raise_s : Sexp.t -> 'a t
  val raise_error : Error.t -> 'a t

  (** Like [Result.ok_exn], except with the performance-friendly properties of [raise]. *)
  val lower_result : ('a, Exn.t) Result.t t -> 'a t

  (** Like [Or_error.ok_exn], except with the performance-friendly properties of
      [raise_error]. *)
  val lower_or_error : 'a Or_error.t t -> 'a t

  (** If evaluating the given effect produces an exception before producing a value,
      [try_with] will return the first exn in the error side of the [Result.t].

      If [rest] is [`Call f], [try_with] will use [f] to handle any further exns produced.
      Otherwise, they will be raised further (i.e. visible to [iter_errors], [try_with],
      and eventual [Expert.handle]/[Expert.eval] calls), although they cannot cause the
      effect itself to raise (i.e. further [try_with]s will result in Ok and handle them
      via its [rest] parameter). *)
  val try_with
    :  ?rest:[ `Raise | `Call of Exn.t -> unit ] (** default is [`Raise] *)
    -> 'a t
    -> ('a, Exn.t) Result.t t

  (** Like [try_with], but returns the exn as an [Error.t]. *)
  val try_with_or_error
    :  ?rest:[ `Raise | `Call of Exn.t -> unit ] (** default is [`Raise] *)
    -> 'a t
    -> 'a Or_error.t t

  (** If exceptions are produced in the course of evaluating the input effect, the
      function passed to [iter_errors] will be invoked with those errors. Multiple errors
      can be produced from functions such as [both_parallel], [all_parallel], and
      [protect]. This doesn't _handle_ the errors, but you can record or print the error.
      Throwing an exception inside of [f] will not recursively invoke [f] on the new error
      that is produced.

      Note that [iter_errors] only calls [f] on exns as they are produced; it does not
      wait for more exns before letting an exn continue to raise. For example,
      [iter_errors (both_parallel (raise a) (raise b)) ~f] will evaluate [f a], raise [a]
      to its next handler, evaluate [f b], and then raise [b] to its next handler. *)
  val iter_errors : 'a t -> f:(Exn.t -> unit t) -> 'a t

  (** [protect] runs an effect, and after the effect completes (including if it fails with
      an exception), it also runs the [finally] effect.

      If the given effect raises an exception, [protect] will output an effect that also
      raises that exception after executing [finally] (even if [finally] also raises). If
      [finally] raises (but not the given effect), the output of [protect] will raise with
      that exception. *)
  val protect : 'a t -> finally:unit t -> 'a t

  (** evaluates both effects in parallel and returns their product when both complete *)
  val both_parallel : 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t

  (** evaluates all effects in the list in parallel and returns the list of results when
      all of them complete. The output list is always the same length as the input list. *)
  val all_parallel : 'a t list -> 'a list t

  (** like [all_parallel], but for [unit Effect.t]s. *)
  val all_parallel_unit : unit t list -> unit t

  (** If creating an effect could be expensive, you can wrap its construction in a lazy
      and pass it to this function so that its construction will be deferred until it's
      about to be evaluated. *)
  val lazy_ : 'a t Lazy.t -> 'a t

  (** Prints the sexp when scheduled. *)
  val print_s : Sexp.t -> unit t

  (** [of_sync_fun] is similar to [of_deferred_fun] but with a synchronous function
      instead of a deferred one. This can be used for functions that are synchronous but
      side-effecting, or as a mock-function in tests that replace the usages of
      [of_deferred_fun] in the actual app.

      Note that, unlike [of_deferred_fun], the function must return immediately, so it's
      not possible to test the behaviour of tour app between calling the function and the
      effect becoming 'determined'. If you need to do this, see [of_svar] and
      [of_query_response_tracker] below. *)
  val of_sync_fun : ('query -> 'result) -> 'query -> 'result t

  (** Like [of_sync_fun] but with a pre-applied unit query. Side-effects in the function
      will be run every time that the resulting effect is scheduled *)
  val of_thunk : (unit -> 'result) -> 'result t

  (** Like [of_sync_fun] but with an extra [on_exn] parameter that can be passed into
      calls to [Expert.handle]. *)
  val of_sync_fun' : ('query -> on_exn:(Exn.t -> unit) -> 'result) -> 'query -> 'result t

  (** Like [of_thunk] but with an extra [on_exn] parameter that can be passed into calls
      to [Expert.handle]. *)

        libraries that actually schedule effects, such as Bonsai, or Virtual_dom.

        [on_further_exns] is called on exceptions that occur after the effect has gotten a
        result/exn. For example, if every branch of an [all_parallel] call raises an
        exception, [on_exn] would be called on the first exn, while [on_further_exns]
        would be called on the rest. There is no guarantee that the callbacks will be
